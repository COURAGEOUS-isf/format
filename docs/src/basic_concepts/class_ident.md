## Classification and Identification
The format allows systems to classify and identify target records through the
appropriately named fields `classification` and `identification`.
The only required field is `classification` while `identification` 
is used to complement the classification.

**Classification** refers to the basic category of the target detected.
The available options are:
- **Unknown**: The C-UAS could not classify the entity with certainty
- **UAV**: Unmanned Aerial Vehicle
- **GCS** : Ground Control Station, the entity is the operator of another entity of the same `uas_id`
- **Other**: The entity doesn't fall in any of the previous categories, e.g. _bird_.

**Identification** refers to a more detailed description of the entity in question. 
This field is optional and is meant to act as a more thorough description of the entity than classification.
As such, it is left free for the company to *include a description more in line with their 
system's capabilities*, whether it's specific information on the target (operatorâ€™s ID, 
ID of the drone, UAV model, etc) or a more robust classification than the one provided.
