# Basic concepts
This document acts as a supplement to the [schema](https://grvc.us.es/courageous/). 
As a result, it **<ins>should not be used as a reference but
a guide<ins>**.

The main procedure should be to:
- Log data either in detection or tracks depending on
[the nature of the data](detec_track.md).
- Organize and distinguish elements through [record fields](record_fields.md)
- [Classify and identify](class_ident.md) objects
- Fill in all fields that the system allows. 
Leaving optional fields blank means the system is incapable 
of obtaining such information.

This document will focus on explaining these concepts.
