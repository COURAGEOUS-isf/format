# Special cases
The format allows a wide range of systems to log information.

As is expected, this diversity gives rise to a variety of structures
depending on the system in question. As a result, some systems
require extra effort when logging data.

This chapter offers a set of examples intended to act as a reference
for both the format and the results expected using  the track visualizer 
(track2kml).
