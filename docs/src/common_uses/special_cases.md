# Special cases
The format allows a wide range of systems to log information.

As is expected, this diversity gives rise to a variety of structures
depending on the system in question. As a result, some systems
require extra effort when logging data.

This chapter offers a set of examples intended to act as a reference
for both the format and the intended results expected using 
track2kml (if desired).
